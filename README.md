**_Explore Safaris_** is an interactive safari application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main users of the application are tourists who plan to visit safaris in Botswana or anyone who could be interested in browsing the application to find out more information about safaris and which places they can explore.

Botswana is a landlord country in Southern Africa. It is bordered by South Africa to the south and east, Namibia to the west, and Zimbabwe to the east. The country is roughly the size of France, yet over 40% of it is protected and conserved for wildlife. This is why the Botswana safaris holidays are unique, so you should absolutely try Botswana Safaris.

*WHAT IS A SAFARI*: 
In the broadest sense, to go on safari is simply to travel. More especially, A SAFARI is an exciting and adventurous way of seeing the ‘real Africa’ because it enables you to view a variety of wildlife in their natural habitat. As a result, going on a safari gives you an authentic experience of Africa. The purpose of a safari tour is to allow you to get intimate with the landscape and scenery. Safaris can involve walking through the wilderness, game viewing by 4x4 safari vehicle, boat, canoe, or small plane, to name a few.

### **Design**
As the central theme of the website is safari, I made all my design choices based on earthy colours & elements.
I researched websites of safaris, to get inspiration for the colour scheme.

#### Fonts
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the overall content I have decided to use the [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?preview.text_type=custom&query=me") Google fonts: Merriweather") font. This font is pleasant to read on screens.

<a></a>
#### Icons
I used icons from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). The icons that were used were are all nautical themed or used to give meaning to a certain section.
I used icons from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/). "Font Awesome").

#### Colours
The colour scheme is based on nautical and sailing colours. I wanted it to feel modern and clean. I used [Coolors](https://icolorpalette.com/) to map out my colour scheme.
